PolymerUITest

Overview
PolymerUITest is an automated testing framework developed for UI testing of applications built with the Polymer library. Using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber, it implements Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles to ensure a robust and scalable test suite thatâ€™s easy to maintain and expand. This framework is structured with the Page Object Model (POM) to improve code readability and reusability.
